Here's a list of fiction books I have really enjoyed. These are in no particular order.

##  [<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">1. The End of Eternity </div>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Eternity)

###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60"> What I liked </div>
Isaac Asimov's 1955 book about time travel and social engineering goes deep into philosophical themes such as what it means to curate history and its social implications.
Do check out for time travel paradoxes, twists, and some serious re-evaluation of what it means to thrive as a society.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  What I wish was better </div>
The human characters are a bit one-dimensional, especially the female characters, which are few and far between. Sure, the 50's wasn't the best time for women, but their portrayal here, and in a lot of Asimov's books in general, is particularly simplistic.

</p>

###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60"> What I liked </div>
This one is for all nostalgia lovers out there, Proust's poetic prose will make you reminisce your childhood and how little things, like the smell of freshly baked cookies in your grandma's oven, could make you fall into a dream-like state that would feel like a small eternity.
Do check out if you have ever stared at your surroundings and started to contemplate whatever brought you to that moment. Also check it out for an interesting take on the nature of memory and perception of time.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  What I wish was better </div>
It is hard to criticise this masterpiece, but if I had to, I would say it might feel a bit dated and slow at times, however, if you stick through it, you probably will be rewarded.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  Memorable quote </div>
<i><strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </strong>Even in the most insignificant details of our daily life, none of us can be said to constitute a material whole, which is identical for everyone, and need only be turned up like a page in an account-book or the record of a will; our social personality is created by the thoughts of other people.<strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </i> </strong>

## [<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">3. The Name of the Rose </div>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Rose)

###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60"> What I liked </div>
Umberto Eco's most well known fiction book can be described as a historical thriller interspersed with theological, philosophical, and semiotic themes. What makes it interesting is that it's a fairly modern, experimental book, set up in a 14th century monastery, which turns out to be the perfect place for a murder mistery, as well as philosophical debates.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  What I wish was better </div>
The first 100 pages can be a bit slow, but necessary in setting up the period and monastery environment.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  Memorable quote </div>
<i><strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </strong>Books are not made to be believed, but to be subjected to inquiry. When we consider a book, we mustn't ask ourselves what it says but what it means...<strong style="font-size:26px; color:#B0B0B0"> " </i> </strong>

## [<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">4. Ulysses </div>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel))

###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60"> What I liked </div>
I am a big admirer of James Joyce for his powerful, symbolism-full, and ultimately movingly beautiful prose. This 800 page book follows a day in the life of Leonard Bloom and each chapter is an experiment in 20th century narrative techniques. Do check out if you're into stream of consciousness or greek mythology, since this is loosely based on Homer's Odyssey.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  What I wish was better </div>
This is admittedly and, infamously so, a very convoluted book and for a good reason. You will need to read an analysis of each chapter in parallel to get the full meaning and all the symbolism the author tried to convey. I found [Sparknotes](https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ulysses/) to be a very useful resource.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  Memorable quote </div>
<i><strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </strong>Every life is in many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves.<strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </i> </strong>

## [<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">5. The Waves </div>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waves)

</p>

###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60"> What I liked </div>
Another great stream of consciousness book, Virginia Woolf's The Waves is mostly about the characters rich inner lives and thoughts, rising and passing over the years, connected, like waves. Do check out for beautiful language, especially her original and surprising epithets, and its themes about identity and our shared human experience.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  What I wish was better </div>
It might be one of those rare cases where I can't find any flaws with a book, but hey, I might be biased since Virginia Woolf is one of my all-time favourite authors.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  Memorable quote </div>
<i><strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </strong>I see nothing. We may sink and settle on the waves. The sea will drum in my ears. The white petals will be darkened with sea water. They will float for a moment and then sink. Rolling over the waves will shoulder me under. Everything falls in a tremendous shower, dissolving me.<strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </i> </strong>


## [<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">6. Logicomix </div>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logicomix)

###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60"> What I liked </div>
I absolutely loved this graphic novel about the foundations of mathematics. It mainly follows Bertrand Russell's quest for the absolute truth and it (surprisingly?) ends up being a very exciting journey as he stumbles into other 20th century influential mathematicians, such as Kurt Godel, David Hilbert and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Do check out if you like puzzles, mathematical paradoxes, and history walkthroughs.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  What I wish was better </div>
Really nothing to complain about here, this was a fascinating 3 hour read!
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  Memorable quote </div>
<i><strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </strong>Well, the Dean has asked me to speak on "The Role of Logic in Human Affairs". Of course, if I take the injunction literally you shall hear the shortest lecture in recorded history!<strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </i> </strong>

## [<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">3. The Brothers Karamazov </div>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov)

</p>

###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60"> What I liked </div>
This Dostoyevsky novel has some of the most complex character development I have seen in a book. It tackles deep philosophical themes, such as how to live one's life, and explores this question by making its central characters have different answers and different world views.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  What I wish was better </div>
I could sense some bias in the author's depiction of which life views are better and would better match his own. I might have have preferred a slightly more neutral stance on the matter, however, this might be my own bias.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  Memorable quote </div>
<i><strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </strong>I love mankind, he said, "but I find to my amazement that the more I love mankind as a whole, the less I love man in particular.<strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </i> </strong>

## [<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">8. The Sound and the Fury </div>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_and_the_Fury)

###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60"> What I liked </div>
At this point, I guess there might be a theme in this list of stream of consciousness books, but I find it a very stimulating and powerful narrative technique, and this is one of the novels that makes full use of it. William Faulkner's novel is structured into 4 chapters, each following the thoughts of a different character and their recollection of a particular family event.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  What I wish was better </div>
This novel again might prove to be a bit convoluted for someone not familiar with the stream of consciousness style, thus I would recommend using a guide in parallel.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  Memorable quote </div>
<i><strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </strong>Clocks slay time... time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels; only when the clock stops does time come to life.<strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </i> </strong>

## [<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">9. The Last Question </div>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Question)
<p align="left">

</p>

###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60"> What I liked </div>
This 8 page short story circles around the theme of AGI and delivers quite an interesting twist at the end. Do check out if you're into the end of the universe and heat death theory, also known as the Big Chill.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  What I wish was better </div>
As with other Asimov books, his portrayal of women is feels dates, hence, one would have to overlook this. Otherwise a pretty fun read!
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  Memorable quote </div>
<i><strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </strong>The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. The question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way ...<strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </i> </strong>

## [<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">10. Brave New World </div>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World)

###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60"> What I liked </div>
Written in 1931, I find Aldous Huxley's dystopian themes very relevant today, ranging from genetic engineering to consumerism and the meaning of freedom. Do check out if you have ever wondered what would happen if everyone was conditioned to be happy and comfortable all the time.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  What I wish was better </div>
Not much to criticise here overall, I found the ideas stimulating and a more subtle, but relevant dystopia than Orwell's 1984.
###<div style="text-align: left; color: #4b5b60">  Memorable quote </div>
<i><strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </strong>Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery.<strong style="font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0"> " </i> </strong>
