Here's a list of fiction books I have really enjoyed. These are in no particular order.

## 1. [The end of eternity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Eternity)
![](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405527675l/509784.jpg =100x)
###<div style="text-align: left"> What I liked </div>
Isaac Asimov's 1955 book about time travel and social engineering goes deep into philosophical themes such as what it means to curate history for a better present and its social implications.
Do check out for time travel paradoxes, twists and some serious re-evaluation of what it means to thrive as a society.
###<div style="text-align: left">  What I wish was better </div>
The human characters are a bit one-dimensional, especially the female characters which are few and far between. Sure the 50's wasn't the best time for women, but their portrayal here (and Asimov's books in general) is particularly simplistic.
###<div style="text-align: left">  Memorable quote </div>
"Out of danger and restless insecurity comes the force that pushes mankind to newer and loftier conquests."

## 2. [Swann’s Way (In search of Lost Time #1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time)

###<div style="text-align: left"> What I liked </div>
This one is for all nostalgia lovers out there, Proust's poetic prose will make you reminisce your childhood and how little things, like the smell of a freshly baked cookie in your grandma's oven, could make you fall into a dream-like state that would feel like a small eternity.
Do check out if you have ever stared at your surroundings and started to comtemplate whatever brought you to that moment of being. Also check it out for an interesting take on the nature of memory and perception of time.
###<div style="text-align: left">  What I wish was better </div>
It is hard to criticise this masterpiece, if anything it might feel a bit dated and slow progressing, however, you should be prepared for it.
###<div style="text-align: left">  Memorable quote </div>
“Even in the most insignificant details of our daily life, none of us can be said to constitute a material whole, which is identical for everyone, and need only be turned up like a page in an account-book or the record of a will; our social personality is created by the thoughts of other people.”

## 3. [The name of the rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Rose)
![](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415375471l/119073.jpg =100x)
###<div style="text-align: left"> What I liked </div>
Umberto Eco's most well known fiction book can be described as historical thriller intersparsed with theological, philosophical and semiotic themes. What makes it interesting is that it's a fairly modern, experimental book set up in a 14th century monastery, which turns out to be the perfect place for a murder mistery and philosophical debates.
###<div style="text-align: left">  What I wish was better </div>
The first 100 pages can be a bit slow, but necessary in setting up the period and monastery environment.
###<div style="text-align: left">  Memorable quote </div>
“Books are not made to be believed, but to be subjected to inquiry. When we consider a book, we mustn't ask ourselves what it says but what it means...”

## 4. [Ulysses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel))
![](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428891345l/338798.jpg =100x)
###<div style="text-align: left"> What I liked </div>
I am a big admirer of James Joyce for his powerful, symbolism-full, and ultimately movingly beautiful prose. This 800 pages book follows a day in the life of Leonard Bloom and each chapter plays is an experiment in 20th century narratice techniques. Do check out if you're into greek mythology, stream of counsciouness, since this is loosely based on Homer's Odyssey.
###<div style="text-align: left">  What I wish was better </div>
This is admitedly and infamously so a very convoluted book and for a good reason. You will need to read an analysis of each chapter in parallel to get the full meaning and all the symbolism. I found Sparknotes to be a very useful resource.
###<div style="text-align: left">  Memorable quote </div>
“Every life is in many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves.”

## 5. [The waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waves)
![](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439492320l/46114._SY475_.jpg =100x)

###<div style="text-align: left"> What I liked </div>
Another great stream of counsciouness book, Virginia Woolf's The Waves is mostly about the characters rich inner lives and thoughts, rising and passing over the years, connected, like waves. Do check out for beautiful language through original and surprising epitheths and its themes about identity and a shared human experience.
###<div style="text-align: left">  What I wish was better </div>
It might be one of those cases where I can't find any flaws with a book, but I might be biased as Virginia Woolf is one of my favourite authors.
###<div style="text-align: left">  Memorable quote </div>
“I see nothing. We may sink and settle on the waves. The sea will drum in my ears. The white petals will be darkened with sea water. They will float for a moment and then sink. Rolling over the waves will shoulder me under. Everything falls in a tremendous shower, dissolving me.”


## 6. [Logicomix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logicomix)
![](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312031956l/6493321.jpg =100x)

###<div style="text-align: left"> What I liked </div>
I absolutely loved this graphic novel about the foundations of mathematics. It mainly follows Bertrand Russell's quest for the absolute truth and it (surprisingly?) ends up being a very exciting journey as he stumbles into other 20th century influential mathematicians, such as Kurt Godel, David Hilbert and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Do check out if you like puzzles, mathematical paradoxes and history walkthroughs.
###<div style="text-align: left">  What I wish was better </div>
Really nothing to complain about here, this was a fascinating 3 hour read!
###<div style="text-align: left">  Memorable quote </div>
“Well, the Dean has asked me to speak on "The Role of Logic in Human Affairs". Of course, if I take the injunction literally you shall hear the shortest lecture in recorded history!”

## 7. [The brothers Karamazov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov)
![](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427728126l/4934.jpg =100x)

###<div style="text-align: left"> What I liked </div>
This Dostoyevsky novel has some of the most complex character development I have read in a book. It tackles deep philosophical themes such as how to live one's life and explores this question by making its central characters have different answers and different world views.
###<div style="text-align: left">  What I wish was better </div>
I could sense some bias in the author's depiction of which life views are better and would better match his own. I would have preferred a slitghly more neutral stance on the matter, however, this might be my own bias.
###<div style="text-align: left">  Memorable quote </div>
“I love mankind, he said, "but I find to my amazement that the more I love mankind as a whole, the less I love man in particular.”

## 8. [The sound and the fury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_and_the_Fury)
![](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1433089995l/10975.jpg =100x)

###<div style="text-align: left"> What I liked </div>
At this point, I guess there might be a theme in this list of stream of counsciouness books, but I find it a very stimulating and powerful narrative technique, and this is one of the novels that makes full use of it. William Faulkner's novel is structured into 4 chapters, each following the thoughts of a different character and their recollection of a particular family event.
###<div style="text-align: left">  What I wish was better </div>
This novel again might prove to be a bit convoluted for someone not familiar with the stream of counsciouness style, thus I recommend using a guide in parallel to make the most of it!
###<div style="text-align: left">  Memorable quote </div>
“Clocks slay time... time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels; only when the clock stops does time come to life.”

## 9. [The last question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Question)
![](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1274107046l/4808763.jpg =100x)

###<div style="text-align: left"> What I liked </div>
This 8 page short story circles around the theme of AGI and delivers quite an interesting twist at the end. Do check out if you're into the end of the universe and heat death theory, also known as the Big Chill.
###<div style="text-align: left">  What I wish was better </div>
As with other Asimov books, his portrayal of women is dated, hence, one would have to overlook this. Otherwise a pretty fun read!
###<div style="text-align: left">  Memorable quote </div>
"The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. The question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way ..."

## 10. [Brave new world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World)
![](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1565605881l/5129._SY475_.jpg =100x)

###<div style="text-align: left"> What I liked </div>
Written in 1931, I find Aldous Huxley's dystopian themes very relevant today, ranging from genetical engineering to consumerism and the meaning of freedom. Do check out if you have ever wondered what would happen if everyone was conditioned to be happy and comfortable all the time?
###<div style="text-align: left">  What I wish was better </div>
Not much to criticise here overall, I found the ideas stimulating and a more subtle, but relevant dystopia than Orwell's 1984.
###<div style="text-align: left">  Memorable quote </div>
“Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery."
