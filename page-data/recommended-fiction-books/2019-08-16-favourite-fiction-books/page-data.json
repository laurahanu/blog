Sure, the 50’s wasn’t the best time for women, but their portrayal here, and in a lot of Asimov’s books in general, is particularly simplistic.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  Memorable quote </div></h3>\n<p><i><strong style=\"font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0\"> ” </strong>Out of danger and restless insecurity comes the force that pushes mankind to newer and loftier conquests.<strong style=\"font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0\"> ” </i> </strong></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time\"><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\"> 2.

Also check it out for an interesting take on the nature of memory and perception of time.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  What I wish was better </div></h3>\n<p>It is hard to criticise this masterpiece, but if I had to, I would say it might feel a bit dated and slow at times, however, if you stick through it, you probably will be rewarded.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  Memorable quote </div></h3>\n<p><i><strong style=\"font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0\"> ” </strong>Even in the most insignificant details of our daily life, none of us can be said to constitute a material whole, which is identical for everyone, and need only be turned up like a page in an account-book or the record of a will; our social personality is created by the thoughts of other people.<strong style=\"font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0\"> ” </i> </strong></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Rose\"><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">3.

What makes it interesting is that it’s a fairly modern, experimental book, set up in a 14th century monastery, which turns out to be the perfect place for a murder mistery, as well as philosophical debates.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  What I wish was better </div></h3>\n<p>The first 100 pages can be a bit slow, but necessary in setting up the period and monastery environment.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  Memorable quote </div></h3>\n<p><i><strong style=\"font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0\"> ” </strong>Books are not made to be believed, but to be subjected to inquiry.

This 800 page book follows a day in the life of Leonard Bloom and each chapter is an experiment in 20th century narrative techniques. Do check out if you’re into stream of consciousness or greek mythology, since this is loosely based on Homer’s Odyssey.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  What I wish was better </div></h3>\n<p>This is admittedly and, infamously so, a very convoluted book and for a good reason. You will need to read an analysis of each chapter in parallel to get the full meaning and all the symbolism the author tried to convey. I found <a href=\"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ulysses/\">Sparknotes</a> to be a very useful resource.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  Memorable quote </div></h3>\n<p><i><strong style=\"font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0\"> ” </strong>Every life is in many days, day after day.

Do check out for beautiful language, especially her original and surprising epithets, and its themes about identity and our shared human experience.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  What I wish was better </div></h3>\n<p>It might be one of those rare cases where I can’t find any flaws with a book, but hey, I might be biased since Virginia Woolf is one of my all-time favourite authors.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  Memorable quote </div></h3>\n<p><i><strong style=\"font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0\"> ” </strong>I see nothing.

It mainly follows Bertrand Russell’s quest for the absolute truth and it (surprisingly?) ends up being a very exciting journey as he stumbles into other 20th century influential mathematicians, such as Kurt Godel, David Hilbert and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Do check out if you like puzzles, mathematical paradoxes, and history walkthroughs.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  What I wish was better </div></h3>\n<p>Really nothing to complain about here, this was a fascinating 3 hour read!</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  Memorable quote </div></h3>\n<p><i><strong style=\"font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0\"> ” </strong>Well, the Dean has asked me to speak on “The Role of Logic in Human Affairs”.

It tackles deep philosophical themes, such as how to live one’s life, and explores this question by making its central characters have different answers and different world views.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  What I wish was better </div></h3>\n<p>I could sense some bias in the author’s depiction of which life views are better and would better match his own. I might have have preferred a slightly more neutral stance on the matter, however, this might be my own bias.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  Memorable quote </div></h3>\n<p><i><strong style=\"font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0\"> ” </strong>I love mankind, he said, “but I find to my amazement that the more I love mankind as a whole, the less I love man in particular.<strong style=\"font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0\"> ” </i> </strong></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_and_the_Fury\"><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">8.

William Faulkner’s novel is structured into 4 chapters, each following the thoughts of a different character and their recollection of a particular family event.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  What I wish was better </div></h3>\n<p>This novel again might prove to be a bit convoluted for someone not familiar with the stream of consciousness style, thus I would recommend using a guide in parallel.</p>\n<h3><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">  Memorable quote </div></h3>\n<p><i><strong style=\"font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0\"> ” </strong>Clocks slay time… time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels; only when the clock stops does time come to life.<strong style=\"font-size:26px; color: #B0B0B0\"> ” </i> </strong></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Question\"><div style=\"text-align: left; color: #4b5b60\">9.
